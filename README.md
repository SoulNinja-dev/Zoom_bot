# Zoom Bot

## Inspiration
To get rid of the tedious process of entering the same meeting id multiple times a day.
## What it does
It reads the meeting id, password, and time from a file, and uses pyautogui to enter everything and login to class at the same time.
## How I built it
I used the python framework `pyautogui` to do the automation, and simple python to make it read the timing and id from the file.
## Challenges we ran into
I ran into one big problem, that is reading from the text file.
but then I fixed it by not using a .txt file but a .csv file which was much easier to read and extract info from.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The whole project, I love automating stuff, and this was amazing to see it work amazingly, I will use this every day from now for all my meetings!
## What we learned
I learned more about extracting stuff from a csv file and using it the way we want it to work
## What's next for Zoom bot | Automate a daily task
a GUI interface, where we can input our timing and dates! (definitely coming by end of February 2021)
